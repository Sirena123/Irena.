Agile methodology

Agile methodology is the most commonly used model. It is a set of principles that promote flexibility and adaptability to frequent changes as opposed to waterfall models. The agile model works by breaking down the whole project into parts that can be specially developed and tested, so there is no need to make a robust development plan.
The agile model is an approach to software development where the whole process is divided into smaller parts or iterations. These iterations are repeated until the project is completed. Each iteration takes time to complete, and in most cases there is a period of two weeks dedicated to one iteration. This model of working on an iteration for two weeks is called a sprint.
- Sprint is a time-limited period with a clearly defined goal. During that time, defined tasks are performed and certain results are achieved. After one sprint is completed, an evaluation is performed and a new sprint begins with changes.
Agile methodology is used not only in testing, but in the entire software development process. It enables close cooperation between the development team and the client. Clients can continuously monitor software development and request changes if necessary. 

Advantages
-Whole process is divided into iterations
-Whole team is included right from the beginning till the end
-Agile model is suitable when there is a lot of requirement changes
-Functioning parts of software can be sent to customers so they can see work in progress

Disadvantages
-It is difficult to assess time needed to complete the whole project at the beginning
-Lack of documentation needed for designing and planning ahead of time, due to possibility of changes
-If client requirements are not clear it is possible to get sidetracked as the work progresses 
-Constant interaction with client and pressure to deliver working parts in time
